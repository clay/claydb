ClayDB
======

ClayDB is an extensible database abstraction layer and data dictionary for PHP 5.3+

ClayDB features two sets of functionality that makes it powerful. 

*    An Adapter feature that allows it to be used for any database. 
*    A Data Dictionary feature that provides table creation and manipulation for any database.

The Adapters and Data Dictionaries have to be present for a specific database to be used. Currently only PDO MySQL is supported, but more databases are planned to be added.

### Development ###
ClayDB is currently transitioning from 1.0 to 2.0. ClayDB 2 has a more complete Data Dictionary and is much more powerful on that particular feature set. We currently sit at ClayDB 1.9.x, we will reach the 2.0 Milestone once SQLite and PostgreSQL support has been added.
